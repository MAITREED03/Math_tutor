In this project, a simple AI App has been built with Python, Streamlit and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Model for solving Mathematics problems.
In the App, user just needs to type in the text box the Math problem that he/she wants to solve then they just need to click on 
the "Solve" button. Our AI Math Tutor will solve the math problem, also show and explain it step-by-step.
It has been tested for few complex math problems of Grade-6 to Grade-11 and it could solve all of them satisfactorily step-by-step with 
detailed explanations.
